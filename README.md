"About Time"

# Game Summary: 

Player navigates a level through rewinding time every time the player jumps. Currently thinking about whether or not each time the player jumps, should they have to change time or not. There would be an incentive to want to rewind time as players might see different outcomes of levels or find hidden pathways unknown before. Might have the opportunity to swap between different parts of the level, the character can swap between multiple pathways or 'realities'. Want our game mechanic to evolve the level through time. There might also be a timing mechanic to finish the level in a certain amount of time so the time jumping would have to be a strategic choice. Some of our core mechanics from this will consist of, replayability, strategy and challnege through timing. There might also be a sense of competitiveness against the player's self, or a global highscoring ability. Would be set as a platformer game.

# Initial Brainstorming and Process Documentation

Player makes a time clone of themself to do different actions throughout the level. Player can time-jump to assist themself. This creates a time 'clone' that can do half of a task and allow for the current clone to finish the other half of the task. An example of this being that the player starts using one of the clones to press down on a button, then jumping back in time to have the second clone run through the doorway opened by the button. 

Since this is a more single playered game, implementing the global high-scoring option would allow for competition between multiple players. 

There may be elemental sections to the map, allowing for fire power ups vs water power ups. These would be used against certain types of elemental enemies. The player woudl only be able to get these power-ups through travelling through the map. These could force certain types of time travel or prevent other types of time travel. An example of this could be that a player has to fight an ice enemy late in the game, but if the player has time travelled ovet the section where he/she receives a fire power up to defeat the ice enemy, the player would be unable to fight the enemy and would have to time travel backwards to find the power-up/weapon. A single cloned player can hold a power-up so it would be almost used as a checkpoint in order to reuse power ups. The player then would weant to make a clone at the point of where the power-up is recieved so that he/she can return to that clone and get the power-up again for future use.

# Values and Core Mechanic - 11.02.2020

We are hoping that our game has a sense of replayability at it's core. There would also be a puzzle mechanic especially in using multiple characters to solve different level challenges. This kind of sets a multiplayer teamw effort into a single player puzzle. We want our players to be able to play throught the level at least once having a positive rewarding experience. But we also want the player to want to replay the level to find hidden power-ups. This then aims the game toward the completionist player. 

An idea we had for this was having some sort of 4 elemental themed puzzle pieces that don't have to be collected to complete the level but would remain grayed out on the screen. This would encoruage the player to replay the levels to find these puzzle pieces.
