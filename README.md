"About Time"

# Game Summary: 

Player navigates a level through rewinding time every time the player jumps. Currently thinking about whether or not each time the player jumps, should they have to change time or not. There would be an incentive to want to rewind time as players might see different outcomes of levels or find hidden pathways unknown before. Might have the opportunity to swap between different parts of the level, the character can swap between multiple pathways or 'realities'. Want our game mechanic to evolve the level through time. There might also be a timing mechanic to finish the level in a certain amount of time so the time jumping would have to be a strategic choice. Some of our core mechanics from this will consist of, replayability, strategy and challnege through timing. There might also be a sense of competitiveness against the player's self, or a global highscoring ability. Would be set as a platformer game.
